# FIUJavaClasswork
Java schoolwork I have completed since enrolling at FIU in Fall 21. In general all the code works correctly unless otherwise stated. Currently I am not writing ReadMes 
for each individual assignment as they all should have descriptions with them.

Key for which project was with which class: <br>
CEN4072: Software Engineering
COP3337: Computer Programming 2 Java
DOB4710: Database Management
